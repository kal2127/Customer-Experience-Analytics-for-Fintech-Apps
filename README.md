# Customer-Experience-Analytics-for-Bank's Mobile App
This project addresses a critical business need for major Ethiopian fintech institutions—the imperative to enhance customer retention and satisfaction within the rapidly evolving mobile banking sector.

Acting as a Data Analyst for Omega Consultancy, the core motivation is to move beyond surface-level metrics and provide concrete, data-driven recommendations to banks (Commercial Bank of Ethiopia, Bank of Abyssinia, and Dashen Bank).

The analysis serves to:

Quantify Experience: Establish a quantitative baseline for customer sentiment and satisfaction.

Identify Pain Points: Automatically extract and categorize the major recurring issues (themes) that drive negative reviews (e.g., login failure, slow transactions).

Benchmark Performance: Provide a comparative analysis across the three institutions to identify relative strengths and weaknesses.

By leveraging advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques on real-world user feedback, this project transforms raw text into actionable strategic advice for product and engineering teams.
