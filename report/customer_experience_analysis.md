## 5. Actionable Recommendations
Based on the data and identified pain points, we recommend the following:

1. **Focus on Stability and Speed:** The highest volume of negative reviews is often concentrated on technical issues (crashes, slow performance). An immediate focus on server stability and app responsiveness is necessary.
2. **Simplify High-Frequency Tasks:** If topics related to 'use' or 'easy' are high, redesign the flow for common actions (e.g., transfers, bill payments) to reduce friction.
3. **Proactive Communication:** For frequently criticized topics, provide in-app notifications about planned maintenance or bug fixes to show users that feedback is being addressed.
